# Components

**Gif**

uses Update function to loop for every texture in the array, first it will pick the first texture from the array and apply it to the target renderer then it will wait for a specific amount of time given in seconds after that will advance to the next texture.

**Fixed Gif**

uses FixedUpdate to update the texture on the target renderer which means delays should be in int value between each frame, you can set this value in the frame delay field.

**Public methods**

`public void Play()`

`public void Stop()`

`public void PlayOnce()`

# Chose Renderer
Target your preferred Renderer from **Render Target** option in Gif component
